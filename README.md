# Brackets
Brackets is an Uwufufu-style image tournament using PyGame & Tkinter in which you can create your own custom tournaments and play them.

I'm not very experienced with python. This project mainly allowed me to familiarize myself with pygame and tkinter, I did it without worrying about the quality of the code itself, I focused only on the result. Feel free to modify and improve the code as you wish.

## Installation
You can get either the compiled .exe version or the .py version.
In order to use the .py version, you will need to have Python-3 installed and added into your system path. You will also need PyGame and Tkinter

### Installing PyGame
```
pip install pygame
```
### Installing Tkinter
```
pip install tk
```
Note that two .ico files are provided. Those are not required to make the program, it is just to have the window icons displayed. I didn't managed to include them into the .exe file.

## Usage
To play your own tournament, create a folder in the same path as the executable and place your own images in it. When you launch the program, select your folder in the "Directory" menu. Then select the number of images you want your game to have.

A folder called "exemple" is provided in order for you to test and see how it works.

Note that if you select too much images (more than twice the number of images you have), the game will not start.
